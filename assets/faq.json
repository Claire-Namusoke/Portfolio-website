    {
      "question": "How much do you use AI in your projects?",
      "answer": "I extensively use AI in my projects, particularly through the integration of OpenAI's language models. AI enhances my data analysis capabilities by enabling natural language processing, which allows users to interact with data using natural language. For instance, in my Streamlit dashboards, I incorporate AI features that let users ask questions about the data and receive insightful responses generated by the model. This not only makes the data more accessible but also provides a more intuitive way for users to explore complex datasets and gain deeper insights."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does data analytics relate to your studies in shipping and chartering?",
      "answer": "Data analytics is closely related to my studies in logistics and supply chain management as it provides the tools and techniques to analyze and interpret data relevant to these fields. In logistics, data analytics can be used to optimize routes, manage inventory, and improve delivery times. In supply chain management, it helps in demand forecasting, supplier performance evaluation, and risk management. By leveraging data analytics, I can make informed decisions that enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve overall supply chain performance."
